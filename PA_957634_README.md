from inside this directory:

$ cp * <ns-3_dir> -r

if ns-3 is a fresh installation:

$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build

onto the main part:
$ sh PA_957634_main.sh

all traces are in PA_957634_helper, all plots are in PA_957634_plots.

I do the plots in png, as gnuplot, for some reason, does not print the legend and the axes, when I use pdf instead of png. Afterwards all plots are put into one pdf via a tex document. If you do not have tex installed on the test machines, you can just look at the pngs, the pdf is really just a bunch of 'includegraphics'.


I talked with another student about task 4 and we shared access to our respective git repos. As of now (Sunday 9pm), parts of my implementation of task 4 is used in their project. I told them: "Wenn du auch meine TwoRay implementation abgibst, dann werden wir beide durchfallen, das waere nicht so toefte â˜¹" and they assured me they were stil working on that task. Probably, this will not be an issue in their final submission and they used my code only for testing, but just in case, I write this.
