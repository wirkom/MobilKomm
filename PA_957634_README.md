from inside this directory:

$ cp * <ns-3_dir> -r

if ns-3 is a fresh installation:

$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build

onto the main part:
$ sh PA_957634_main.sh

all traces are in PA_957634_helper, all plots are in PA_957634_plots.

From past experiments I know, that my shell scripts often don't work on other shells (normally between my laptop and my pc in the uni some stuff breaks). I tested this on 3 systems. If there are still problems: Send me a mail (mirwagner@uos.de) and your config and I try my best to fix it.
